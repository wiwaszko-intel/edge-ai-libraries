# Robot Motion Control Task
## Overview

**Robotmctask** is a comprehensive C++ library designed for robot motion control task development. It provides APIs that enable robot developers to build sophisticated robot applications with integrated AI inference engines and EtherCAT protocol support.

# Key Features:

- **PLCOpen Compliance:** Support for PLCOpen motion control function blocks
- **Multi-Task Support:** Concurrent handling of multiple motion control tasks
- **Real-Time Integration:** Seamless shared memory communication between real-time and non-real-time domains
- **AI-Powered Control:** Built-in  inference engine support for intelligent motion control
- **Simulation Ready:** Comprehensive motion control simulation capabilities

## Architecture Overview

The architecture is as following:

Two key blocks have been introduced to support the core architecture:

* **libectask** is a dynamic library that provides a set of public APIs for EtherCAT real-time task creation. Key capabilities include:
    - **EtherCAT Integration:** Creates motion function blocks to operate EtherCAT slaves using ENI configurations
    - **Network Topology Support:** Handles slave configurations and network topology definitions
    - **Flexible Memory Management:** Supports custom shared memory callbacks for data restructuring between real-time and non-real-time domains
    - **AI Pipeline Integration:** Enables AI inference callback registration within real-time tasks

* **libinference** is a shared library offering advanced inference capabilities with:
    - **Modern C++ Interface:** New C++ classes for streamlined inference implementation
    - **Reinforcement Learning Support：** Integrated RL classes optimized for robotic applications. To facilitate quick demonstrations of code functionality, provide a stable-standing ONNX model based on real robot. This model maintains whole-body balance by controlling the lower limbs while the upper body performs hand movements. Such a model enables humanoid robots to remain stable through reinforcement learning when the upper limbs are engaged in VLA tasks.
    - **Performance Analytics:** Built-in statistical collection for performance monitoring
    - **Intel OpenVINO integration:** Default inference engine with extensible architecture
    - **Extensible Design:** Bases classes enabling custom AI model development

### Examples

One example using Robot Motion Control Task is provided.

* [mc_rl_sample](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/tree/release-2025.2.0/libraries/edge-control-libraries/fieldbus/robotmctask/examples):
A comprehensive demonstration showcasing:

    - **Multi-Topology Configuration:** Robot task setup with multiple topologies using different ENI files
    - **Distributed Control:** Three separate ectasks controlling distinct EtherCAT topologies:
        - Left/Right Arm Control
        - Leg control systems
    - **Dual Arm Integration:** Joint state publishing via shared memory for VLA(Vision-Language-Action) models or simulator integration
    - **Custom Motion Algorithms:** Leg control with registered callbacks for customized motion algorithms and inference pipelines
