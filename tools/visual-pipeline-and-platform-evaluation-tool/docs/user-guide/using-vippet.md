How to use ViPPET
============================================

The [pipeline configuration article](./using-vippet/configuring-pipelines.md) explains step-by-step how to configure
and test AI pipelines using ViPPET's Pipeline Builder, from creating a new pipeline, editing the pipeline elements,
to demonstrating running pipelines on both CPU and GPU to compare performance.

The [performance testing article](./using-vippet/performance-testing.md) covers performance testing of single pipelines
as well as multiple pipelines running concurrently.
